## Description















Tool-making marks the moment when our ancestors transcended their biological limitations. Around 3.3 million years ago in East Africa, early hominids began deliberately shaping stones to create sharper edges, longer reaches, and stronger impacts than their hands could provide.

This seemingly simple act - striking one stone against another to create a cutting edge - represents humanity's first great cognitive leap. It requires understanding cause and effect, planning for future needs, and the ability to see potential in raw materials. The Oldowan tools of Homo habilis, crude by modern standards, were revolutionary achievements that enabled our ancestors to process tough plant materials, break bones to access marrow, and begin the journey toward mastering their environment.

Tool-making is not just about the artifacts themselves, but about the cognitive revolution they represent. Every hammer, lever, and blade since those first chipped stones traces its lineage back to this fundamental realization: we can improve upon what nature provides. This technology didn't just change what early humans could do - it changed how they thought, establishing the pattern of innovation that would eventually lead from stone choppers to space telescopes.
