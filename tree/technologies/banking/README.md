## Historical Development

### First Emergence
First appeared ~1150 CE

### Locations
- Italy
- Islamic world
- China

### Key Innovators
- Medici family
- Templar knights
- Islamic bankers

### Parallel Invention
This technology was invented independently in multiple locations.

### Evolution
Banking evolved from temple and merchant storage to specialized financial institutions. Italian city-states developed double-entry bookkeeping and letters of credit, while Islamic banking created interest-free financial instruments. Modern banking includes central banks, electronic transfers, and algorithmic trading.

## Technical Details

### How It Works
Banking intermediates between savers and borrowers, transforming short-term deposits into long-term loans while managing liquidity and risk. Banks create money through fractional reserve lending - keeping only a fraction of deposits as reserves while lending the remainder, effectively multiplying the money supply through credit creation.

### Materials & Resources
**Materials needed:**
- Secure vaults: physical storage for coins, documents, and valuable items
- Accounting systems: ledgers, contracts, and record-keeping materials
- Communication networks: messengers, postal systems for remote transactions
- Branch locations: strategically placed offices for customer access

**Knowledge requirements:**
- Mathematical finance: interest calculations, risk assessment, and profitability analysis
- Legal expertise: contract law, property rights, and dispute resolution
- Market intelligence: understanding trade patterns, currency fluctuations, and economic cycles
- Credit evaluation: assessing borrower creditworthiness and collateral value

**Social requirements:**
- Trust relationships: reputation for reliability and honest dealing
- Legal frameworks: enforceable contracts and property rights protection
- Political stability: predictable governance and currency stability
- Commercial networks: connections with merchants, traders, and other banks

## Impact & Consequences

### Immediate Effects
Banking enabled long-distance trade by providing secure money transfer and foreign exchange services. It allowed merchants to travel without carrying large amounts of coin, reducing robbery risk. Credit services funded commercial ventures that individuals couldn't afford independently.

### Long-term Consequences
Banking accelerated economic development by efficiently allocating capital to productive uses. It enabled larger-scale enterprises and reduced the cost of commerce through standardized financial instruments. The technology created boom-bust cycles through credit expansion and contraction.

### Technologies Unlocked
- **credit-systems**: Formal lending relationships enable large-scale commerce and investment
- **international-finance**: Cross-border capital flows support global trade networks
- **investment-banking**: Specialized institutions fund major infrastructure and industrial projects

### New Capabilities
- **capital-formation**: Pooling savings to fund large investments beyond individual capacity
- **risk-management**: Diversification and insurance mechanisms reduce financial uncertainty
- **economic-development**: Efficient capital allocation accelerates productivity growth

### Synergies
Banking combines powerfully with trade (financing), law (contracts), and mathematics (financial calculations). It enables joint-stock companies, insurance systems, and government financing through bonds.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Islamic banking**: Interest-free finance using profit-sharing and asset-backed transactions
- **Cooperative banks**: Member-owned institutions serving specific communities
- **Temple banking**: Religious institutions providing financial services with sacred backing
- **Merchant banking**: Trade-based finance integrated with commercial operations

## Modern Context
Contemporary banking includes central banks managing monetary policy, investment banks facilitating capital markets, and digital banks operating without physical branches. Cryptocurrency and decentralized finance challenge traditional banking intermediation while regulatory technology monitors systemic risk.

## Lost Knowledge
Many traditional Islamic banking instruments and medieval Italian financial innovations were sophisticated solutions lost during economic disruptions. Some historical risk management techniques and credit evaluation methods developed over centuries represent irreplaceable practical wisdom.

## Implementation Notes
Success requires understanding that banking is fundamentally about managing trust and information asymmetries. Build reputation through consistent, conservative practices before expanding services. Develop robust accounting systems to track complex transactions accurately. Maintain adequate reserves for unexpected withdrawals or loan losses. Create strong legal relationships and recovery procedures. Start with simple deposit and lending services before attempting complex financial instruments.
