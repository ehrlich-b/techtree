### Synergies
Renewable energy combines powerfully with electricity (grid systems), physics (energy conversion), and advanced materials (efficiency improvements). It enables sustainable development, energy independence, and climate solutions.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Nuclear power**: Clean electricity generation through atomic energy
- **Energy efficiency**: Reducing power consumption rather than increasing clean generation
- **Fossil fuel improvements**: Carbon capture and cleaner combustion technologies

## Modern Context
Contemporary renewable energy uses advanced materials, artificial intelligence optimization, and grid-scale storage while achieving cost parity with fossil fuels in many markets.

## Lost Knowledge
Some early renewable energy designs and traditional energy conservation methods disappeared with modern technology. Historical approaches to passive solar design represent partially lost architectural knowledge.
