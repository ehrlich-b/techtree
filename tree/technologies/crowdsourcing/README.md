## Overview
Using large groups of people to solve problems or create content

## Type
Social Technology

### Soft Requirements
- None

### Catalysts
- **[social-media](../social-media/README.md)**: [How it accelerates development]

## Historical Development

### First Emergence
First appeared ~2006 CE

### Locations
- United States
- Global internet communities

### Key Innovators
- Jeff Howe
- Internet entrepreneurs
- Platform developers





### Parallel Invention
This technology was invented independently in multiple locations.

### Evolution
Crowdsourcing evolved from traditional outsourcing to distributed online collaboration. Development included Wikipedia, crowdfunding platforms, citizen science projects, and gig economy platforms creating systematic crowd coordination.

## Technical Details

### How It Works
Crowdsourcing harnesses large groups of people to solve problems, create content, or perform tasks through online platforms that coordinate distributed contributions and aggregate collective intelligence.

### Materials & Resources
**Materials needed:**
- Digital platforms: websites and applications for coordinating crowd participation
- Communication systems: tools for organizing and managing distributed contributors
- Payment systems: mechanisms for compensating contributors when appropriate
- Quality control systems: methods for evaluating and filtering crowd contributions

**Knowledge requirements:**
- Platform design: understanding of user experience and crowd motivation
- Task decomposition: breaking complex problems into manageable crowd-sized pieces
- Quality assurance: methods for ensuring accuracy and usefulness of crowd contributions
- Community management: skills for building and maintaining active participant communities

**Social requirements:**
- Participant communities: large groups willing to contribute time and effort
- Trust systems: mechanisms enabling reputation and quality assessment
- Incentive structures: motivation systems encouraging sustained participation





## Impact & Consequences

### Immediate Effects
Crowdsourcing enabled distributed problem-solving, reduced costs for certain tasks, and created new forms of collaborative work while demonstrating the power of collective intelligence.

### Long-term Consequences
Crowdsourcing transformed work arrangements, enabled citizen participation in science and policy, created gig economy platforms, and established new models for innovation and knowledge creation.

### Technologies Unlocked
- **citizen-science**: Public participation in scientific research and data collection
- **gig-economy-platforms**: Digital marketplaces for distributed freelance work
- **collaborative-knowledge**: Systems like Wikipedia enabling collective information creation

### New Capabilities
- **crowd-coordination**: [Description]
- **distributed-work**: [Description]
- **collective-creation**: [Description]

### Synergies
Crowdsourcing combines powerfully with internet (global reach), social media (participant recruitment), and mobile devices (ubiquitous access). It enables distributed innovation, collaborative problem-solving, and collective intelligence.

## Alternative Approaches
- **Traditional outsourcing**: Contracting work to specific companies or individuals
- **Internal teams**: Using dedicated employees for all tasks and problem-solving
- **Expert consultation**: Hiring specialists rather than leveraging crowd wisdom

## Modern Context
Contemporary crowdsourcing uses artificial intelligence for task routing, blockchain for trust systems, and mobile platforms while expanding into areas like medical research and environmental monitoring.

## Lost Knowledge
Some early crowdsourcing experiments and community-building techniques evolved with platform development. Historical approaches to volunteer coordination represent evolved rather than lost practices.

## Implementation Notes
Success requires understanding that crowdsourcing demands clear task definition, appropriate incentives, and quality control mechanisms. Design tasks that are engaging and appropriately sized for crowd participation. Create user-friendly platforms minimizing barriers to participation. Develop reputation systems building trust and encouraging quality contributions. Establish fair compensation when appropriate. Build community features encouraging sustained engagement. Remember that crowdsourcing success depends on participant motivation, task design, and effective crowd coordination.
