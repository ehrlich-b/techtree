## Overview
Selective breeding and taming of wild animals

## Type
Material Technology

## Prerequisites

## Historical Development

### First Emergence
First appeared ~15,000 BCE

### Locations
- Near East
- China
- Andes
- Mesoamerica

### Key Innovators
- Early herders

### Parallel Invention
This technology was invented independently in multiple locations.

### Evolution
Animal domestication evolved from initial taming of wild species to systematic breeding for specific traits. Development included dogs from wolves, livestock from wild ancestors, and specialized breeding creating diverse domestic varieties adapted to human needs.

## Technical Details

### How It Works
Animal domestication uses selective breeding, behavioral conditioning, and environmental control to develop animals adapted to human purposes, creating ongoing relationships benefiting both species through mutual dependence.

### Materials & Resources
**Materials needed:**
- enclosures
- feed
- breeding-stock


**Knowledge requirements:**
- animal-husbandry
- selective-breeding


**Social requirements:**
- herding-practices
- ownership-systems

## Impact & Consequences

### Immediate Effects
Animal domestication provided reliable protein sources, labor assistance, and materials while creating new agricultural possibilities and enabling human settlements to support larger populations.

### Long-term Consequences
Animal domestication transformed human society by enabling agriculture, transportation, and complex civilizations while creating new disease vectors, environmental impacts, and fundamental changes in human-animal relationships.

### Technologies Unlocked
- **plowing**: [How this enables it]
- **transportation**: [How this enables it]
- **dairy**: [How this enables it]

### New Capabilities
- **animal-labor**: [Description]
- **meat-production**: [Description]
- **material-sources**: [Description]

### Synergies
Animal domestication combines powerfully with agriculture (plow animals), hunting tools (herding), and cooperation (pastoral societies). It enables transportation, textile production, and intensive agriculture.

## Alternative Approaches
- **dog-sledding**: Different solution to same problem
- **llama-packing**: Different solution to same problem
- **horse-riding**: Different solution to same problem

## Modern Context
Contemporary animal domestication uses genetic science, industrial breeding, and biotechnology while grappling with ethical concerns about animal welfare and environmental sustainability of intensive farming.

## Lost Knowledge
Many traditional animal husbandry techniques and indigenous breeding knowledge disappeared with industrial agriculture. Historical understanding of animal behavior and traditional pastoral practices represent lost expertise.

## Sources & Further Reading
- *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by Jared Diamond - analysis of domestication's civilizational impact
- *The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication* by Charles Darwin - foundational study
- *Domestication and Early Agriculture* studies - archaeological evidence and processes
- *Animal Domestication* by various authors - comprehensive development survey

## Implementation Notes
Success requires understanding that domestication is a long-term process requiring patience, observation, and understanding of animal behavior. Start with species showing naturally social or docile traits. Provide consistent food, shelter, and protection. Practice selective breeding for desired characteristics over multiple generations. Maintain genetic diversity to prevent inbreeding problems. Remember that domestication creates mutual dependence requiring ongoing care and responsibility.
