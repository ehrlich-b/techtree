## Continuous Considerations

### Quality Metrics
- Technologies have multiple prerequisite paths where historically accurate
- No modern technology is unreachable
- Every civilization's contributions are represented
- Lost technologies are documented
- Alternative developments are plausible

### Balance Concerns
- Avoid Eurocentric bias
- Include non-Western innovations
- Recognize simultaneous invention
- Document technological regression
- Show environmental influences

### Educational Goals
- Inspire curiosity about history
- Reveal non-obvious connections
- Challenge progress narratives
- Encourage critical thinking
- Provide research starting points

## Notes on Approach

1. **Start small, build complete** - Better to have 50 fully documented technologies than 500 stubs
2. **Test continuously** - Validate after each phase
3. **Respect complexity** - Don't oversimplify for the sake of clean graphs
4. **Document uncertainty** - When history is unclear, say so
5. **Iterate based on learning** - The tree will teach us as we build it

## Current Priority

Complete Phase 0 and Phase 1 before moving to content creation. The infrastructure must be solid before we start building the tree itself. Once we have good tools and a clear schema, the actual technology documentation will flow much more smoothly.

Remember: We're not just building a database - we're creating an interactive monument to human achievement that should inspire people to think deeply about how we got here and where we might go next.
